WHITEOUT STORIES
This game consist of a story, collaboratively written by a number of players.
It's a cross-platform app for mobile devices made with the Ionic framework and Angular.
It has no server backend for now, all text and game data are stored on the mobile device.
Turns are taken by tapping a button before passing the device around between players, so this is starting out as a post-covid game, and should eventually evolve into a covid-compatible game when I get around to connecting it to a backend, so texts can be sent around over the internet instead.

Stay tuned for a description of the twist in this game!
